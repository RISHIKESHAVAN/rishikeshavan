## 🧑 About me:

<p>
  Being a strong advocate of life-long learning, I believe that great leaders are able to succeed because they are able to continually learn. This mindset has enabled me to grow throughout my life, turning adversities into opportunities of improvement.

  After my undergraduate degree in Production Engineering, my interest in coding and the desire to explore the financial world motivated me to accept the <b>Technology Analyst</b> role at Citicorp Services. During my experience at CITI, I developed my skills in <b>application programming</b>, <b>CI-CD</b> and <b>Enterprise Container Solutions (Docker-Kubernetes)</b>. I regularly used my skills to solve problems for clients by building scalable and highly resilient systems. I love <b>problem solving</b> and have a proven track record of consistently providing efficient solutions with a solid work ethic, 

  Currently, I am pursuing my <b>Masters in Data Sciences and Business Analytics</b> - a highly ranked program (#4 QS worldwide ’22) provided by ESSEC Business School and CentraleSupelec in France. I am building a deep understanding of data sciences and the methods of business analytics, with the aim to lead changes in business practices, technologies and tools.
  
  My recent interest has been contributing to open-source projects - something that I had thinking to do for a very long time. Super happy to have finally started it and it is going great! Do get in touch if you have an interesting project that I can contribute to!
